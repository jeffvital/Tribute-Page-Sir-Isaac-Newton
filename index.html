        <section>
          <h3>Invented the reflecting telescope</h3>
          <p>
            The standard telescope of Newton's time, the refracting telescope,
            was not ideal. Its glass lenses focused the different colors
            inherent in light at different distances. This resulted, at the
            edges of any bright objects seen through the telescope, in colored
            fringes that rendered those objects slightly out of focus. Newton
            solved the "chromatic aberration" problem by using mirrors instead
            of lenses. His original reflecting telescope, which he built himself
            in 1668, was just six inches long. This modest device not only
            eliminated the colored fringes but magnified whatever it focused on
            by 40 times, which, as Newton noted at the time, "is more than any 6
            foote Tube can do." After presenting his scope to the Royal Society,
            the then-unknown Newton was proposed for membership; he later served
            as its president for 24 years, until his death in 1727.

          <h3>Proposed new theory of light and color</h3>
          <p>
            Not long after he donated his telescope to the Royal Society, Newton
            delivered a paper to that august body about his novel theory of
            light and colors. Using prisms and his usual very exacting
            experimental technique, Newton had discovered that sunlight is
            comprised of all the colors of the rainbow, which could not only be
            separated but recombined into white light. "[T]he most surprising
            and wonderful composition was that of Whiteness," he wrote. "I have
            often with Admiration beheld that all the Colours of the Prisme
            being made to converge, and thereby to be again mixed ... reproduced
            light, intirely [sic] and perfectly white." Though he made his
            experiments on light as early as 1666, when he was only 24 years
            old, he didn't publish his classic Opticks, which summarized his
            findings on light and color, until 1704.

          <h3>Discovered calculus</h3>
          <p>
            When Newton began to muse on the problem of the motion of the
            planets and what kept them in their orbits around the sun, he
            realized that the mathematics of the day weren't sufficient to the
            task. Properties such as direction and speed, by their very nature,
            were in a continuous state of flux, constantly changing with time
            and exhibiting varying rates of change. So he invented a new branch
            of mathematics, which he called the fluxions (later known as
            calculus). Calculus allowed him to draw tangents to curves,
            determine the lengths of curves, and solve other problems that
            classical geometry could not help him solve. Interestingly, Newton's
            masterwork, the Principia, doesn't include the calculus in the form
            that he'd invented years before, simply because he hadn't yet
            published anything about it. But he did combine related methods with
            a very high level of classical geometry, making no attempt to
            simplify it for his readers. The reason was, he said, "to avoid
            being baited by little Smatterers in Mathematicks."

        <section>
          <h3>Developed three laws of motion</h3>
          <p>
            Newton's Principia is difficult to comprehend on two levels, even
            for experts: in its original form, it is written in Latin, and it
            uses very challenging mathematics. Yet one thing that comes out very
            simply and very clearly to all is his three laws of motion: Law of
            inertia: Every object persists in its state of rest or uniform
            motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change that
            state by forces impressed upon it. Law of acceleration: Force is
            equal to the change in momentum (mV) per change in time. For a
            constant mass, force equals mass times acceleration, F = ma. Law of
            action and reaction: For every action, there is an equal and
            opposite reaction. To these Newton added, in the Principia, two
            general principles of space and time, many careful explanations, and
            much else besides. All of this went into his classic explanation of
            how the universe works, otherwise known as Newtonian mechanics.
            (Mechanics developed into a branch of physical science that deals
            with energy and forces and their effect on bodies.)

          <h3>Devised law of universal gravitation</h3>
          <p>
            Newton said shortly before his death that it was seeing an apple
            fall in his mother's garden that set him thinking "that the power of
            gravity ... was not limited to a certain distance from the earth but
            that this power must extend much farther than was usually thought.
            Why not as high as the moon ... and if so that must influence her
            motion and perhaps retain her in her orbit." This brainstorm (which
            some scholars suspect Newton may have invented late in life)
            ultimately led to his law of universal gravitation. The law says
            that all particles of matter in the universe attract every other
            particle, that gravitational attraction is a property of all matter.
            The law explained many things, from the orbits of the planets around
            the sun to the influence of the moon and sun on the tides. And it
            held sway as the accepted description of terrestrial and celestial
            mechanics for almost 200 yearsâ€”until Einstein came along and rocked
            the boat with relativity.

          <h3>Advanced early modern chemistry</h3>
          <p>
            Newton spent untold hours of his life practicing alchemy. Like other
            alchemists, he sought to turn base metals into gold, find a
            universal cure for disease, and secure the elixir of life, which
            promised perpetual youth and eternal life. In his garden shed
            outside his rooms at Trinity College, Cambridge, in the midst of
            phials and furnaces, mortars and pestles, Newton pored over ancient
            texts and performed endless experiments. Yet while he never found
            what he and other alchemists sought, and while he only published one
            short paper that grew out of his alchemical experiments (a two-page
            speculation on acids), his work was not for naught. As the historian
            Jed Buchwald has said, "As historians have shown in the last several
            decades, there was a much more profound element to the practice of
            alchemy which really makes it deserving of being called early modern
            chemistry." Through his meticulous efforts, Newton greatly furthered
            the practice and techniques of chemical science.

        <section>
          <h3>Became father of modern science</h3>
          <p>
            Newton essentially invented many elements of the modern scientific
            method. His paper on the properties of light that he presented to
            the Royal Society in the early 1670s shows all the hallmarks of the
            method he would use throughout his long life: conducting experiments
            and taking very careful notes on the results; making measurements;
            conducting further experiments that grew out of the initial ones;
            formulating a theory, then creating yet further experiments to test
            it; and finally, painstakingly describing the entire process so that
            other scientists could replicate every step of the way. This method
            governs how all science is conducted today. Newton once famously
            said, "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of
            Giants." Many scientists today would argue that the greatest Giant
            of all in the world of science was Isaac Newton himself.
